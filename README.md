# Hey there 👋 ![Visitors](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=marinang&label=Visitors)

## 🧔🏻 About me 
I am a French physicist, a data scientist and a Python enthusiast.

🧑🏻‍🎓 I just finished a PhD in experimental particle physics at EPFL, working on the data collected by the LHCb detector at CERN between 2016 and 2018 (RunII data). You can find my manuscript here [📖](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/279779?ln=fr).

📊📉 Since 01/02/2021 I am a Data Analytics Consultant at [Argusa](https://www.argusa.ch/?lang=en).  

## 📈 Check out my projects

* Analysis of the [Online Retail II dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II) provided by the UCI, which contains transactions (including cancellations) carried out by an online retailer (mainly focused on gift items) between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The project is divided in 4 parts:
  * EDA and extraction of the most relevant business insights in the dataset.
  * Segmentation the customers into groups according to their purchase patterns and product purchases, and characterise/ quantify the obtained customer personas.
  * Customer churn prediction by the end of 2011.
  * Calculation of Customer Lifetime Value for each customer.
  
  The notebook and code of the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/marinang/online_retail_analysis).
